Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same asset in different markets in order to profit from tiny differences in the asset's listed price. It exploits short-lived variations in the price of identical or similar financial instruments in different markets or in different forms. 

Arbitrage is trading that exploits the tiny differences in price between identical assets in two or more markets. The arbitrage trader buys the asset in one market and sells it in the other market at the same time in order to pocket the difference between the two prices.

There are more complicated variations in this scenario, but all depend on identifying market "inefficiencies."

Arbitrageurs, as arbitrage traders are called, are usually working on behalf of large financial institutions. It usually involves trading a substantial amount of money, and the split-second opportunities it offers can be identified and acted upon only with highly sophisticated software.

_____

In this project, I am taking on the role of an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The vice president (VP) of your department is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, can one capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas?

I will sort through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase then apply the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.

This aspect of the project will consist of 3 phases.

Collect the data.

Prepare the data.

Analyze the data.
